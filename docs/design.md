## Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
I would like to add this heuristic by making the site more usable. As of now the site doesn't have much usability.

## Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
I would add this heuristic by making my cite have a clean look and I would use stale or darker colors rather than neon-like colors.

## Color Scheme and Typography
I plan to go with a background color of beige. I chose this color because it's almost white, but it's not quite. Sort of like a softer white.
The typography I'm going to use is just the default font.
